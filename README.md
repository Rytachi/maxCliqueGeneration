$ Bronn.exe file [[-s] [-f]] [n]    

With no parameters, program will execute Bronn algorithm with random 1000 vertex graphs twelve times increasing edge count by 10000 starting at 20000.
The other way to run the program is to provide a file to read a graph from, choose where to print the results, -s console, -f file, and how many times to repeat the experiment. For example: Bronn.exe graph1.txt -f 1000.
